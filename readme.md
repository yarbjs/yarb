# YARB - Yet Another React Boilerplate ðŸŽ‰

Probably one of the biggest challenges in learning React is setting up the right tooling. There are lots of ways to do this like [create-react-app](#) and [Glitch](#). And now, there's one more!

YARB ships with all the basic tooling you need to start playing with React and React Router. It also includes application bundling courtesy of [Parcel](https://parceljs.org), a neat zero-configuration bundler. YARB also includes out of the box SCSS/SASS support (because SASS is incredibly useful and basically necessary).


## Installation/Use
You'll need [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) and [Node](https://github.com/nodejs/node) to build and develop with YARB

- Clone or fork this repo
- `cd yarb` (or whatever you renamed it to)
- `yarn install` (or `npm install`)
- `yarn start`. This will kick off Parcel and a web server. It will reload your site automatically for you as you work ðŸ™Œ
- Make cool things inside `/src`. There are some basic styles and routes included to give you a place to start.
- `yarn build` makes a static site ready to deploy on your webserver of choice for the world to see
